              <h3>Hi, I'm Lilas. Nice to meet you.</h3>
              <p>I've worked in fashion for 7 years and went through different jobs.
              <br/>
              Even if i was really passionate about what I was doing, I felt like i needed to get deeper into the tech world.
              While studying at Le Wagon, where I got my diploma, I fell in love with web programming.
              <br/>
              I now want to be a full-stack developer and maybe match it with my professional background.</p>
